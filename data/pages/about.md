Hi I'm Andrew

I live at home with 2 small Senegal parrots.  They come first in this because they're more important than programming.  They're called Merlin and Charlie and are disproportionately loud given their size.  My friends hear them through discord all the time and confirm they are indeed pains in my arse.  They like to chime in on meetings so I live on mute.

If you just want to know about me professionally, my LinkedIn profile is [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewgoacher/) or just take a look at [my job history](/cv).

I've been programming for a while now, at least 10 whole years.  I still feel way out of my depth, all the time.  I first attempted to learn around 2003 when being 13 felt a good age to become a hacker.  It turns out, that navigating the wars between C and C++, and the entire C communities racism to languages like Java and C# was a little too much for me back then.  I decided to wait until I went to university, where I chose to study Computer Games Programming.

The rest is kind of history (ish).

These days I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what kind of developer I actually am.  I'm a big fan of TDD and pragmatic approaches but I'm trying to find a balance between delivery and longevity.

At work, I tend to use .NET languages (well, if we're being specific, I use C#) and javascript technologies most of the time and you wouldn't be too far off if you called me a web developer.

At home, I play around with a lot of different technologies.  This website is written in HTML (using Tera templating) and Rust.  I like F#, C# (with MonoGame most of the time) and anything else that tickles my fancy.
