I've somehow managed to miss most conferences until this year.  I've never been comfortable asking my company to send me there and most of the time they tend to be quite pricey.  Instead, I've attended quite a lot of meetups.  

This year, a friend had the opportunity to speak at UpFront Conf, and so I decided to attend mostly for moral support.  I was also lucky enough to win a ticket to ReactJS Girls, and my company (AND Digital) were more than happy to pay for my trains down to London.  I quite enjoyed both experiences and do intend to check out other conferences, although I'm hoping to branch away from just attending front end focussed conferences.

Initially, my plan was to do a write up per event.  While I did get a lot from both conferences I don't think I would have enough content to write about.  Instead, I'm hoping to explore some of the technologies discussed and potentiall write about those.

## Things I did that I shouldn't have

This is mostly for London

I took a bag full of stuff.  Doesn't sound too bad really, but it meant carting around a bunch of things that I didn't need and didn't use.  It was a long day, I could have packed less.

I wore jeans.  Again, doesn't sound too silly but they got more and more uncomfortable as the day went on.  Travel in tight-fitting (and getting tighter through the day) jeans was abysmal.  Looser fitting and well-aired clothing is ideal.  The London conference was horribly warm.

I accepted the conference before checking commute times.
This was probably my biggest mistake, I didn't realise just how long my day would be.  I had to be on a 6am train to get there before 9am - which turned out to be less an issue anyway as the registration period lasted until 10am.  I also got a later train home than needed so I could spend time with friends.  I never regret spending time with friends, but I do regret not counting on train delays existing.  I was out of my house for 20 hours!

## Things I didn't do that I should have

I didn't bring deodorant.  I can't have been alone in regretting this one.  ReactJS Girls was hosted in a volcano I think.  It was very, very warm and I think I would have preferred to have been feeling slightly less self-conscious before mingling.

I didn't research the speakers beforehand.
This speaks true for both conferences, and I should have learned from the first one.  Some of the speakers were speaking about things that they have recently published in a blog or a book.  Some of the speakers/hosts were authors or contributors to books, podcasts or technologies I know of and use.
A few hours of reading up on them would have been really beneficial to me.

I didn't take many notes.
This was probably the worst.  At Upfront Conf I took zero notes.  At ReactJS Girls, I placed a handful of keywords into a Trello card.  It's quite hard remembering everything you hear as is. 
I think for me, hand-written or laptop is better.  My phone is too difficult to type on and took too much of my attention.  The other 2 methods are both somewhat automatable - my brain and my body can kind of do their own thing.

Get enough sleep! 
I went down to London with just 4 hours of sleep.  While I would have slept better for upfront conf, owing to being able to wake at a reasonable time, I should have ensured I was well rested and alert for both conferences.

## General takeaways

Some of the talks I assumed I wouldn't like, I loved.  At upfront conf, I found I enjoyed the first talk immensely which was based around ethics.  I enjoyed it more because the speaker was obviously a very gifted speaker.  I found some talks which I assumed I would enjoy the most to be lacking and thus didn't enjoy as much.

This is all OK though and should be expected.  Accept that you can be disappointed, but also don't rule out or dismiss a talk because you don't think the topic is interesting.

Lastly for me, whether a person is new to talking, or just doesn't give a good talk, don't be a dick about it.  It's OK to dislike the content or delivery of a talk but be nice and professional about it.
